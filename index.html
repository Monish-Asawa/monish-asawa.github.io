                Hello! I'm Monish Asawa, a passionate student at IIT Hyderabad, pursuing a degree in Mathematics and
                Computing. I have a keen interest in web development and competitive programming, constantly seeking
                opportunities to enhance my skills and create meaningful projects.
                <br>
                Apart from coding, I have a deep appreciation for clean and intuitive user interfaces. I believe that
                user experience is at the heart of every successful website or application, and I always strive to
                create seamless and delightful experiences for users through thoughtful design choices and intuitive
                interactions.
                <br>
                Outside the world of coding, I enjoy staying active through outdoor activities like hiking and playing
                sports. These pursuits help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and stimulate creativity.
                I am excited to continue my journey in web development and competitive programming, seeking
                opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and make a positive impact in the digital realm. If
                you'd like to collaborate or have any questions, feel free to reach out!
